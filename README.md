# 🤖 Machine Learning Quiz with NLP! 🧠
Welcome to an exciting quiz powered by Machine Learning and Natural Language Processing (NLP)! 🚀 This quiz isn't just about answering questions, it's about training a model to understand your answers and learn from them! 🌟

# How it works:
# Answer Questions: 📝
1. You’ll be presented with a series of questions about Python, Machine Learning, and NLP.
2. Each question will have multiple options to choose from.
3. You'll select the answer that you think is correct.

# Training the Model: 🏋️‍♀️
As you answer each question, your responses are used to train a machine learning model that learns your preferences and improves its predictions over time.

# NLP Magic: ✨
The power of Natural Language Processing (NLP) will be used to understand and classify your answers.
NLP will extract key keywords and context from your text-based answers to better predict future results.

# Quiz Form: 🔍
You’ll receive links and references for each question for more in-depth learning. 📚

# Example Questions:
1. What is Python used for? 🐍
2. Which algorithm is commonly used for classification? 📊
3. What is NLP? 🧠

# Why is this quiz so special? 🌟
1. Learning in real-time: The model will train as you take the quiz, improving its predictions based on your answers!
2. Personalized: As you keep answering questions, the system will adapt and provide better responses tailored to your choices. 🤩
3. Educational Links: At the end of the quiz, you'll get links to resources related to each question so you can dive deeper into the topics!

# Technologies Used 🔧:
1. Python 🐍: The backbone of this project, helping to run the logic and the model.
2. Machine Learning (ML) 🤖: To train a model based on your answers.
3. Natural Language Processing (NLP) 🧠: To analyze and understand your text-based answers.
4. Jupyter Notebook 💻: The development environment used to bring everything together!
